# IR Range Extender for Flipper Zero

Flipper Zero has de ability of sending IR signals, but it has very short range.
This boards allows you to extend the range of your Flipper Zero using IR.

The difference with other boards is that this one has both wide angle (120ยบ) group of high power IR emitters and narrow angle (14ยบ) group of high power IR emitters, so you can reach undefined targets (when you don't know where exactly is the IR receiver) and far and well defined targets.

These groups of IR LEDs are selectable by a tiny switch.

The board connects to Flipper in a way that barely increases the size of the device.
